## Section 1

- variables
#a variable is any word of your choosing that holds a value of meaning in your code.
#you can use variables to help make your process easier and in some cases it may even be necessary to make your code run.
#to define a variable you will need to use the = sign.
#define a variable as the number zero, and then print the variable. to print use print("variable")

- arrays
#an array is a list of values or words. the way to make an array is similar to the way to make a variable.(they always need square brackets"[]")
#to make an array you will need to use the = sign.
#try making an array with your friends' names in it.

- if/else
#an if/ else statement is a way to make the computer follow a variety of different possibilities
#essentially its a conditional statement so that if something isn't true the computer can follow a different course

- for loops
#a for loop is essentially a repeated line of code
#you can ask the computer to cycle through things such as an array until it reachers whatever it is you want in the array
#try making a for loop where you try to find a specific number in an array


## Section 2

- nesting
  - if/else
  - for loops
#nesting is a loop, you can make if/else statements or for loops that run forever
#we don't want a program to run forever so we can use this so that it looks for whatever you want and then stops

- if/else
#an if/ else statement is a way to make the computer follow a variety of different possibilities
#essentially its a conditional statement so that if something isn't true the computer can follow a different course
- for loops
#a for loop is essentially a repeated line of code
#you can ask the computer to cycle through things such as an array until it reachers whatever it is you want in the array
#try making a for loop where you try to find a specific number in an array



- methods
# this last thing I will teach you is called a method or a function
# methods can be used to condense a bunch of lines of code
# its a block of code which will only run when you ask it to, if you need the code later on you can just use a few lines rather than re-type the whole thing



assessment:

1. Create an array with any numbers
2. Create a function
3. inside of the function create a for loop and an if/else loop where you try to find a specific number in the array
